# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Location.create(city: "Bumblefudge, NY, USA")
#
# Location.create(city: "NYC")

# User.create(name: "Bobby Jones", username: "BJBoi", password: "password")


# Concert.create!(name: "Chili fiesta", date: "1992-11-4", opener: false, artist: "rhcp", venue:"MSG")
# #
# B = User.first
# #
# C = Concert.first
# #
# B.concerts << C


# Concert.create(name: "Chili fiesta redux", date: "2012-11-4", opener: false, artist: "rhcp", venue:"MSG")
